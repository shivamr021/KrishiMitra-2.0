    # Tomato Diseases

    "Tomato leaf bacterial spot": "Apply copper-based sprays. Difficult to control once established. Remove infected plants to prevent spread.",
    "Tomato leaf late blight": "Very serious. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately. Use preventative fungicides like chlorothalonil.",
